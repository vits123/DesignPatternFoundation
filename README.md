# Foundational Design pattern

Basics of most commonly used design pattern using Java.

## Observer
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
This pattern defines a one-to-many (1 publisher has many subscribers) dependency between objects 
so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Decorator
Decorator pattern is based on open-closed principle which states that classes should be open for extension (adding new classes or functionality)
but closed for modification.
This pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.It provides flexible alternative to instead add more subclasses.

## Iterator
This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object (collection of objects like arraylist) sequentially
without exposing its underlying representation.
